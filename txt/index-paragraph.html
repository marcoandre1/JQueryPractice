This is a html file. It is displayed using jquery load. This is a test but would
be cool if it works. Also how is this text displayed? <br>
Just trying to see if this is in another line. <br>
Or maybe this one. Who knows?...
<br><br>
So if you write in, like you would do in html, you get all the same properties. <br>
<strong>This is a strong text.</strong><br>
<i>Bye!</i>
