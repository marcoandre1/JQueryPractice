<p>So today I came up with this website: <br />
    <a href="https://www.textfixer.com/html/convert-text-html.php">
        https://www.textfixer.com/html/convert-text-html.php
    </a><br />
    It says it can convert text to html. This came to my mind after trying to format my own text. It can be done quite easily I think with some programming languages. I may try to make a converter of my own. I still don&rsquo;t know if every blog written on the internet has to be formatted to html. It seems logical to me that yes. Because this is the only way the browser is going to know how the text has to be displayed.<br />
    Maybe some websites have some converter integrated. Or maybe you can save a word document to html format. I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe you can and you don&rsquo;t even have to bother using a text to html converter.<br />
    I will try it as I save this in Word.<br />
    Well, I tried. Unfortunately, it saves a whole new html webpage. I tried all different options but they create files that are just too big and useless. And because it creates a whole new html file, it also creates the styles for the file which affects the style of the website. So, it is not a very good option.<br />
    I will try the converter now.<br />
    Ok, so a few things. Normally Word uses a margin between lines. When you copy paste the text that nice margin doesn&rsquo;t stay. So the text is not going to appear as you see it in word. Second, you have to be careful of the options you chose. You should use the option &ldquo;Use paragraph and line break tags&rdquo;. Finally, it doesn&rsquo;t support link references for websites for example. So, you must add those after you converted your file. It stills better than the attempt to save Word in html in my opinion.<br />
